# User Management App

A basic project designed to learn and demonstrate **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** using **EJS** (Embedded JavaScript Templates). This application is built with the following technologies:

- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime for building scalable applications.
- **Express.js**: A fast and minimal web framework for Node.js.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used for storing user data.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for creating responsive, modern designs.
- **EJS**: A templating engine for rendering HTML with embedded JavaScript on the server.

### Features:
- User listing page that dynamically displays users stored in a MongoDB database.
- Basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for user management.
- Responsive and modern design with Tailwind CSS.

This project is a great starting point for learning the fundamentals of building web applications using server-side rendering and integrating a database with Node.js.
